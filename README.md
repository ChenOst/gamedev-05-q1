Moves the pendulum.
The user can add his own values to:
- `Position x, y, z` - The user can choose the starting position of the object,
 by setting value to the X axis, Y axis and Z axis.
- `Direction` - The direction in which the pendulum will rotate.
- `Angle` - The angle of the rotation, the angle value can be between 0 and 90.
- `Speed` - The speed of the rotation.

In order to move the ball around you can use the arrow keys (<- and ->)
The user can add his own values to:
- `Speed` - Determine the speed of the movement.
- `Radius` - The distance between the current x position to the center of the circle.
(The center of the circle is positionX + radius).
